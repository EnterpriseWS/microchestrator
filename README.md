# microchestrator
This project is an implementation of Saga pattern for microservices. It focuses on serving as a lightweight and high performance hybrid, between Choreography-based and Orchestration-bsed, service. Its user can configure Microchestrator through the service's registration.json and orchestration.json files to best suit its purpose.

The architecture diagram below illustrates the relationship between Microchestrator and custom microservices and IoT devices.
